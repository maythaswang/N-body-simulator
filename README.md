# N-body-simulator
----------
This project aims to Simulate interactions of N-bodies in using Particle-Particle Method. The project provides option to use either Compute Shaders written in `glsl` or simple CPU implementation.

Note: The project is currently a WIP.

### Features:
- Velocity-Verlet and Euler Integrator
- Spawning cluster of bodies into shape such as discs and globular clusters.
- Although the project does not support taking arguments yet, setups can be done after launching the program.

----------
### Setting up
Simply use the scripts provided in `./QOL_Snippets` to build and run the program.
